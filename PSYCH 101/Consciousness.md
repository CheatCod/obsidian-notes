# Consciousness

*William James* introduced the useful metaphor of the *Stream of Consciousness* to psychlogy. **He compared conscious thought to water moving through a channel**. He argued that conscious thought shared many characteristics with water moving through a channel. Like a stream, thought flows continuously and is dynamic (constantly changing). Sometimes thoughts are calm but at other times they can be turbulent, and thoughts can have depth.

Not all thought is conscious, most thought occurs **outside our conscious** awareness

```ad-example
When evaluating the attractiveness of a stranger, our brain “calculates” all kinds of information about that person such as age, facial expression and body symmetry. **We do not have direct access to the computations**. All we know is the end result of the processing. **Only this final stage is available to consciousness.**

The stream of consciousness also helps us to conceptualize two ways in which conscious thought can vary.

## Quantitative Changes in Consciousness
_Quantitative_ changes in consciousness reflect changes in the stream’s depth. The magnitutde of consciousness increases as we rise to the surface and decreases as we sink to the depths.

For ex, when writing an exam, a lot of consciousness is present (high magnitute).
When we fall asleep, less consciousness -> low magnitute

## Qualitative Changes in Consciousness
_Qualitative_ changes in consciousness reflect changes in the essence of the stream itself.

Dreams reflect a form of thought that is different from waking thought, thus dreams offer a different experience of consciouness, rather than more or less consciousness.
