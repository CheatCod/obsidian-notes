*William James* introduced the useful metaphor of the *Stream of Consciousness* to psychlogy. **He compared conscious thought to water moving through a channel**. He argued that conscious thought shared many characteristics with water moving through a channel. Like a stream, thought flows continuously and is dynamic (constantly changing). Sometimes thoughts are calm but at other times they can be turbulent, and thoughts can have depth.

Not all thought is conscious, most thought occurs **outside our conscious** awareness

```ad-example
When evaluating the attractiveness of a stranger, our brain “calculates” all kinds of information about that person such as age, facial expression and body symmetry. **We do not have direct access to the computations**. All we know is the end result of the processing. **Only this final stage is available to consciousness.**

The stream of consciousness also helps us to conceptualize two ways in which conscious thought can vary.
