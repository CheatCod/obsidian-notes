# Hypnosis

**Franz Mesmer** was an Austrian physician who beame renowned for "healing" people of of various ailments through an routine called *Animal Magnetism*. Although originally involving magnets, Mesmer ultimately stopped using them, as they didn’t seem to be a necessary component of the treatment.

What Mesmer had stumbled across was a systematic procedure for producing a **heightened state of suggestibility**. Today we call this procedure _Key TermHypnosis_, the name given to it by another physician named **James Braid** in 1843.

## Hypnotic Phenomena: Myth and Reality
Dispelling three common myths of hyponosis:
1. individuals do not become stronger or more capable while under hypnotic suggestion.
2. you cannot compel someone under hypnosis to commit acts they would otherwise refuse to do without hypnosis., ex. suicide or murder
3. Third, hypnosis is not capable of recovering lost memories. In face, the heightended suggestibility is better suited for introducing inaccuracies into exsiting memories.

  Phenomena can be achieved with hypnosis:
1.  Anesthetic effects
2.  Disruption to normal perceptual processes (hallucination). Subkects can be convinced to see objects that are not presents, as well as fail to see objects right in front of them.
3.  Disinhibited social behavior, hypnotized subjects are more easily led to perform actions that many would consider embarrassing under other circumstances, such as disrobing in public or clucking like a chicken
4. Post-hypnotic suggestion. This occurs when a suggestion is made to a hypnotized subject that specifies the performance of some action after awakening, usually in response to a cue. Post-hypnotic amnesia is an example of this.  If the hypnotist instructs them not to remember, then they will recall nothing of their experience once they awaken.

# Theories of Hypnosis
## Socio-cognitive Theory
Proponents of the socio-cognitive model include Barber and Spanos, In this theory, hypnosis occurs when suggestible individuals play the social role of a hypnotized person.

A _Social role_ reflects the expectations of a person in a particular social context. The role dictates what behaviours are typical for the person in that context, as well as what rights (permissions) and what responsibilities (obligations) they might have.

People’s experiences with “age regression” while hypnotized are consistent with this view. As in one study, hypnotized subjects were "regressed" back to childhood and asked to draw pictures. The pictures produced looked very different from the pictures drawn by actual children. They more resembled an adult’s expectation of how a child draws

This theory has difficulty explaining phenomena such as anesthetic.
## Dissociative Theory

An alternative to the socio-cognitive model is the _Dissociative Theory_, which proposes that hypnosis is in fact an altered state of consciousness; that the hypnotized state is a qualitative variation in consciousness.

_Dissociation_ occurs when mental processes split into separate streams of awareness operating in parallel.

Highway Hypnosis: driving a car, started to think about something else, and then suddenly realized you had arrived at your destination without paying any attention
This is not uncommon for those who frequently travel to the same place along familiar routes. In this case, consciousness splits into two streams. One is your conscious awareness of your thoughts, and the other part of your mind is maneuvering the vehicle.

When hyponosis is induced, the theory suggests that consciouness diverges into 2 separate streams
