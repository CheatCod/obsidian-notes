# Question 1
```ad-note
- fraction n/d where n and d are int
- d is NON ZERO
- The most simplified form is stored, i.e 4/8 -> 1/2
- Negatives are stored with negative numerator and positive deno, i.e. -1/4
- Divided by  0 is undefined
- Rational numbers that have a denominator of 1 are printed as integers e.g. 17/1 is printed as 17
```
- [ ] negate

	- [x] negative ops positive
	- [x] positive ops positive
	- [x] positive ops 0
- [ ] =+, =-

# Question 2
```ad-note
- $(9/4)x^3 + (−7/3)x + 3/2$ is represented by the array of Rationals $\set{3/2, −7/3, 0/1, 9/4}$
- The default constructor for Polynomial should create the zero polynomial
- Terms with zero coefficients are not printed
- Coefficients are printed using the output format for Rational numbers as described in Q1.
- A term whose exponent is 1 is printed as (a/b)x and a term whose exponent is 0 is printed as (a/b)
- Each term is non zero
- Input exp must be decreasing, non-negative
```
