```ad-example
Suppose approximately 1 person in 100,000 is hit by lightening in a season.  Let $X$ be the number of people hit in a town with a population of 10,000 people. Find the mean and variance of $X$.

Sol:
Let $X$ be the number of people in the town hit by lightning.

Then $X$ is $Bin(n, p)$, where $p = \frac{1}{10,000}$ and $n = 10,000$

Since $n$ is large and $p$ is small, $X$ is approximatel $Poisson(\mu)$
$E(X) = \mu$
$= n \times p$
```

## Variance of Binomial Distribution
if $X \sim Bin(n, p)$ then $Var(x) = np(1-p)$
