# Normal (Gaussian) Distribution
❌✔️✅📗
```ad-def
A random variable $X$ defined on $(-\infty, \infty)$ has a normal distribution denoted $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ if the p.d.f. is of the form 

$$
f(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^{2}}{2 \sigma^{2}}}, for -\infty < x, \mu < \infty, \sigma > 0
$$

Where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are parameters.

$E(X) = \mu$ and $Var(X)=\sigma^2$
