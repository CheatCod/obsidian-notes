**Joint Probability Functions of $(X,Y)$**

For two [[Random Variables|random variables]] $X$ and $Y$, the function 
$$
f(x, y)=P(X=x \text { and } Y=y)=P(X=x, Y=y)
$$

Is called the joint probability function of $(X,Y)$

---
For $n$ random variables $X_1,...X_n$, the joint probability function is

$$
f\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)=P\left(X_{1}=x_{1}, X_{2}=x_{2}, \ldots, X_{n}=x_{n}\right)
$$
```

The joint probability function records the probability of all possible combination.


# Marginal Probability Functions
```ad-def
The marginal probability of $X$ is the probability function for $X$ obtained from the joint probability function. 
```

```ad-example
$P(Y=0):$
