# Dream

Dreams are an example of altered consciousness (a qualitative variation of normal waking consciousness).
- brain waves look very similar (both are composed of high frequency, low amplitude beta waves) to awake
- Dreams typically follow a narrative.

# Why Do We Dream?
## Purpose:
#### Theory of Wish Fulfillment
In 1899, **Sigmund Freud** developed the earliest psychological theory of dreaming.
He believed that inappropirate desires that's dangerous to express were relegated to the unconscious part of the mind in order to hide them from the ego.

According to him. the unconscious holds a large but *finite* things, as unexpressed desires accumulate, the unconscious becomes overcrowded, and we begin to experience anxiety as dangerous thoughts are forced into the conscious part of the mind.

We relieve the pressure through dreams, which provide a safe exploration of otherwise dangerous desires.

##### Manifest Content
_Manifest Content_ is the **literal content of the dream**. It represents those aspects of the dream that we are aware of. For instance, if you dream about a train travelling through a tunnel, the manifest content is the train, the tunnel, and the action of the train progressing through the tunnel.

##### Latent Content

_Key TermLatent Content_ is the **symbolic content of the dream**. Perhaps the train is not just a train but is also a symbol for another type of object. Similarly, the tunnel might not reflect an actual tunnel but is also a symbol, and the train entering the tunnel really symbolizes some other type of action.

Freud believed that psychotherapist could reveal the content of the unconscious by studying the latend content of dreams through **Dream Analysis**

#### Theory of Problem Solving
Psychologist **Rosalind Cartwright** proposes that dreams reflect ongoing preoccupations with problems we encounter in our waking life, and that the benefit of dreams is that we will discover novel or creative solutions that we could not otherwise because logic centres in the brain are inactive while sleeping.

Although dreams provide us an opportunity to identify problems, and occasionally might lead to solutions, *it seems unlikely that this is the primary purpose of dreams*

#### Theory of mental house keeping
As we progress through our daily life, different new bits of information result in new synapses forming in our brain. The connections are fragile, and may fall apart easily. One way to strengthen theses connections is to excercise them by running signals through the same pathways that were formed, which make new memories more durable and stable. This process is called **Consolidation**

According to this theory, dreams allow the brain to consolidate important new connections.

Therefore, a prediction from this theory is that memory should be worse when deprived of dreaming, but not deprived of sleep. A _Selective Deprivation_ study is done during which the participant is woken up each time they enter REM sleep, but are otherwise allowed to accumulate eight full hours of non-REM sleep during the same evening, those who were selectively deprived of REM sleep performed significantly worse on a memory test the following day.

this finding may explain the purpose of REM sleep rather than purpose of dreams.
## By-product:
### Activation-synthesis
According to the _Activation-synthesis Model_, dreams are an artifact of spontaneous neuronal activity originating in the brainstem during REM sleep. A structure at the base of the brainstem called the _Pons_ becomes active during REM sleep, projecting neuronal signals into higher order brain areas in the cerebrum.
