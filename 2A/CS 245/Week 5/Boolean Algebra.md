# Boolean Algebra
```ad-def
 A Boolean algebra is a set *B*, together with two binary operations + and $\cdot$ , and a unary operation NOT, The set *B* contains elements 0 and 1, is closed under the application of the operations, and the following properties hold for all x, y, z, in *B*:
- Identity law: $x + 0 = x, x \cdot 1 = x$.
- Complement laws: $x + \bar{x} = 1, x \cdot \bar{x} = 0$
- Associativity laws: $(x + y) + z) = z + (y + z), (x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z)$
- Commuatativity laws: $x + y = y + x, x \cdot y = y \cdot x$
- Distributivity laws: $x + (y \cdot z) = (x + y) \cdot (x + z), x \cdot (y + z) = (x \cdot y) + x \cdot z)$
