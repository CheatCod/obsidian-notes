# Empty premise set

$\emptyset \vdash A$ iff $\Sigma \vdash A$  for any $\Sigma$ (addition of premise)

What does it mean? 

Recall from [[Formal Deduction in Propositional Logic#^{7482de|definition]], $A$ is said to be *formally provable from $\Sigma$* when $\Sigma \vdash A$ holds

When $\emptyset \vdash A$ holds, $A$ is said to be formally provable (from nothing)
