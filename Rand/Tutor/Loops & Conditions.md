# While loop

```java
while (CONDITION IS TRUE) {
	// some code here to execute
}
```

# For loop

```java
for (INITIALIZE; CONDITION; POST-LOOP) {
	// some code to execute
}
```

Example:

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
	System.out.println("I like apples");
}
```

^^^ will print "I like apples" 5 times.

Note:

Any for loop expression can be written in a semantically equivalent while loop, and vice versa
