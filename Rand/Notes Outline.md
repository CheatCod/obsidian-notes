**(AE)**: audience engagement

# Intro
- Brief intro about myself, name, program & year
- Personal gratitude, thanks the audience for their time
- Thanks STEM for Girls for inviting me
- Objective of the event: to give exclusive insights on the CS program in UW that's not mentioned by the university
- Elements of the event
	- The first part will be a general presentation on my experience with UW
	- The second part will be a QnA session
- Stay muted for the main presentation
		- If you have a question/participation leave a message in chat
		- (raises hand before speaking?)

# Main Presentation
## About myself
-	CS club
-	UHS Robotics  (**(AE)** show of hands, who has heard of or is in robotics)
-	Side projects
-	Other extracurriculars(film making etc etc)

## About UW
**(AE)** who has been to UW's open house or events? University fairs?
- Here are some fun facts about UW
### CS Program
- Once you are in CS, you'll gain access to a vast amount of CS courses

some first year courses in particular:
-	CS 135
	Unlike most other university's introdution CS courses, cs 135 does not use a well known language such as Python or Java, instead, the entire course revolves around the functional programming language Racket.
	
	Due to that, the course is very hard to adjust to, since most of your previous experiences will most likely not apply here.
	
-	Math 135
	- Formal proofs
	- A lot of logics required
	- A lot of abstract concepts
-	Math 137
	-	Nothing like highschool calculus
	-	A lot of proofs

### Campus life
-	Quiet with minimal distraction
-	Living cost is reasonable
-	Lacks entertainment 

# Why not UW
-	If you are not motivated in CS & Math 
-	If you want to do academia (grad school, research)
-	If you want an interesting university life (city life, night life, party life, general entertainment -> go to ut or ubc or queens)
-	If you HATE working and school back to back
-	If you want to take quality non-STEM related electives, minors, specializations.
-	No historic aspect (like UofT)
