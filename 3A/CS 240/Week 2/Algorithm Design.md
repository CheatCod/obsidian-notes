# Algorithm Design

CS 240 main topic: given problem $\Pi$, design algorithm $A$ that solves it, and analyze its efficiency

**Step 1.** Describe algorithm idea.
**Step 2.** Give a detailed description.
**Step 3.** Argue correctness.
	- Invariants are good
	- while loop and recursion terminates.
**Step 4.** Analyze the efficiency
	- We are primarily concerned with runtime, but sometimes care about space.

**Step 5**. Implementation.
	- Implementation can be costly/complicated/takes a while.
	- expriement do not transfer
