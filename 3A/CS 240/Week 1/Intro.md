# Problem
1. Description of input and desired output
	- Sorting: Given numbers, order them in increasing order
	- Structured searching: Given data with keys, search by key
	- Unstructured searching, given text, search for a string
2. Algorithm: step-by-step process to modify input
3. Recursive: Algorithm that uses itself with smaller parameters
4. Solving: Finishes in finite time, has to work with every problem instance
5. Runtime: the number of computing steps
6. The size of the input: use $size(I)$ or $|I|$ for a problem instance $I$
7. Worse-case: even for the possible input 
8. $O$: Ignore constant factors and lower order terms in run-time bound
