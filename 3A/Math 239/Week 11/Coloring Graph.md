Let $G = (V,E)$ be a simple graph.

Let $k \ge 1$ be an integer.

A proper $k$-colouring of $G$ is a function

$f : V(G) \to \set{1,2,3,...,k}$ 

with the property that if $vw \in E$ then $f(v) \neq f(w)$

Chromatic number of $G : \chi$ is the smallest $k$ for which $G$ has a proper $k$-colouring


**Graph of small chromatic number**

$\chi = 0$, empty graph
$\chi = 1$ at least 1 vertex, no edge
$\chi = 2$ bipartite with at least one edge
$\chi = 3$ no good characterization
