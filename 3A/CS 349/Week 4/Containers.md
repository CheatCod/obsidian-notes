# Fixed Layout

Layou does not move nodes.

You need to specify width, height, and position of all nodes manually

## Group

- Contain children that are rendered in order whenever this node is rendered.
- Take collective bound of its children and not directly resizable 
- Any transform, effect, or state applied to a group will be applied to all children of that group

## Pane


# Variable Intrinsic

The layout attempts to use the widget's preferred sizes, but queries all widgets first and allocate space to them

## VBox

## HBox

# Relative Layout

The layout constrains child positions into a specific layout 

## AnchorPane

`AchorPane` allows the edges of child nodes to be anchored to an offset from the anchor pane's edges

## BorderPane


## GridPane


## TilePane

# Meta Containers

## ScrollPane

- In a scroll pane, the items always stay in their prefered size

## TabPane

## MenuBars
