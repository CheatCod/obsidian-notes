# JavaFX

JavaFX applications extend the `Application` class, which is the core class in JavaFX.

# Scene Graph

A scene graph is a tree structure that arranges all the elements of a screen into a hierarchy.

## Stages and Scenes
JavaFX composes an interface as a scene graph - a tree where every item has 0 or 1 parent.

One “root” node, typically a top-level layout.

- Stage is the main window
- Scene is the scene graph that you want to display
