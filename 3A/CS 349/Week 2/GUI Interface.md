# GUI Interface 

## Advantages:

- Graphical objects result in more familiarity to the users' own language
	- Ex. desktop, folder, drag-and-drop

**Consistent interface elements** also help to make a GUI explorable and predictable for users.

# Indirect vs. Direct Manipulation

## Indirect manipulation:
Ex. modifying a SVG-file 
Modifying the SVG file itself

**Advantages:**
- Can be perfectly precise 
- Can be automated

**Disadvantages:**
Bad in terms of interaction design, requires knowledge of text editor, SVG file

## Direct manipulation:

> [!INFO]
> Direction manipulation is when a virtual representation of data is manipulated in a similar way to a real world object

- Continuous representation of the object of interest
- Continuous feedback and reversible
- Incremental actions
- Physical actions instead of complex syntax

### Adaption to the Dekstop

Modern GUIs do not always use direct manipulation:

- Due to the complexity of the digital world, many objects have properties that cannot be easily represented using DM
- Many commands are invoked indirectly (menu, dialogue boxes)
- Many objects in the interface are not object of interest
