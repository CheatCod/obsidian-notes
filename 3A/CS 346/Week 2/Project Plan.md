# Project Plan

- To identify **project goals**, **resources**, and **constraints**, **risks** and **mitigation** strategies

## Goals

- 1-2 sentence summary statement on what the project is trying to accomplish
- Direct goals: build a product
- Indirect goals: eg. provide someone with frontend experience

## Resources
- Identify resources available and constraints that apply to these resources

## Risks

- For every risk there should be a mitigation strategy


# Project Tracking

## Triple Constraint Model

The triple constraint model states that time, scope and cost all impact quality to work

If you **increase scope**, then I have to add resources (staff and pay â†’ **more cost**)

If you **decrease time**, then I have to **increase costs**

## Tracking Scopes & Time

We want to track progress at different levels:

**High-level**: tracking the high level project goals

**Low-level**: how are we progressing

## Terminology

- **Task**: Some piece of work
	- **Dependencies**: The order that needs to be enforced between tasks, where one task depends on the completion of another
	- **Critical path**: The longest path in your project, the path
- **Milestones**: Deadlines
