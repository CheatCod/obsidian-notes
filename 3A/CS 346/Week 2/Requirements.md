# Requirement

Requirement can be collected into a number of sources

## Business Requirements
Ensure that we understand the business requirements.

1. Review the requirements
2. Ask clarifying questions
3. Log them as issues in project tracking system
4. Review and assign them as usual

## User Requirements
- Who are my users
- What is important to them
- What are they trying to accomplish
- What could I do to address these issues for them

> [!note] Stakeholders vs Users
> **Stakeholder:** people that have interest in your product
> **Users:** people who could potentially use your product
> All users are stakeholders, but not all stakeholders are users

## Types of Requirements

### Technical
Technical implementation issues, these might have value to a customer, but dont neccessarily represent new functionality being implemented

### New feature

### Bug fixes

## Requirements vs Issues
