# What is a project

**Task:** an action that has a desired outcome

**Project:** a set of more complex tasks that collectively produce a desired outcome. Project are usually 
- More complex than individual tasks
- Comprised of many tasks 
- Repeatable using the same steps

**Stakeholder:** any person or entity that has an interest in your project's outcome

**Product:** 


# Project Activities

**Communication:**

**Planning:**

**Modelling:**

**Construction:**

**Deployment:**

# Process model

A process model defines the complete set of activities that are required to specify, design, develop, test and deploy a product, and describes how they fit together.


## Waterfall model

Envisioned software production as a series of steps, each cascading into the next one, much like a waterfall.

**Problems:**
1. Customer priorities will likely change over the course of the project
2. For many types of software, design, and construction are interwoven.
3. Analysis, design, construction, and testing are not predictable

These chanllenges make it *extremely* difficult for any linear process model to work effectivlyâ€”at least for software

# Oher process models



# Agile
- Agile isn't a single process, but rather an approach to sofftware development that encompasses this philosophy
- Encourages team structures and attitudes that make communication easier
- Emphasizes rapid delivery of operational software

- Iterate until you and customer together decide that you are done

# Extreme programming

- An Agile methodology focused on best-practices for programmers.

Five core values:
- Communication: Communication within the team and with the cusomer.
- Simplicity: Build the simplest thing that will work
- Feedback: Team members solicit feedback from each other. Eg. code review
