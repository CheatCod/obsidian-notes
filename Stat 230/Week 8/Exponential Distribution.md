The exponential distribution is often used as a model for  random time until some event occurs. 

```ad-def
The continuous random variable $X$ is said to have an **exponential distribution** if its p.d.f. is of the form $f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$ for $x > 0$ where $\lambda > 0$ is a real parameter value.
