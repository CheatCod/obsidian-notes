# Exponential Distribution
❌✔️✅📗

The exponential distribution is often used as a model for random time until some event occurs. 

In a [[Poisson Distribution|poisson process]] for events in time, let $X$ be the length of time we wait for the first event occurence.

Then $X$ has an exponential distribution


```ad-def
The continuous random variable $X$ is said to have an **exponential distribution** if its p.d.f. is of the form $f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$ for $x > 0$ where $\lambda > 0$ is a real parameter value.

```ad-thm
The c.d.f. of an Exponential random variable is $F(x) = 1 - e^{- \lambda x}$ for $x \leq 0,$ and $F(x) = 0$ for $x < 0$
