# Bernouli trials
```ad-def
Suppose we have an experiment with 2 possible outcomes which are *Success*(S), and *Failure*(F). Suppose also that $P(S)=p$. Every repeat of the experiment is called a *trial*. Such a sequence of independent trials are called **Bernouli Trials**

```
Let the [[Random Variables]] $X$ be the number of successes in $n$ Bernoulli trials.

<u>Key assumptions</u>:
1. The probability of success $P$ must be **constant** over $n$ trials
2. The $n$ trials must be **independent**

```ad-thm
The **probability function** of X is

$$f(x)={n \choose x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}, \text{for }x = 0,1,2...n
