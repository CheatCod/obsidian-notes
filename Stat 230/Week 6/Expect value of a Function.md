# Expect value of a Function
❌✔️✅📗
```ad-def
The expectation of some function $g(X)$ of a random variable $X$ with the probability function $f(x)$ is 
$$\begin{align*}
E(g(X)) &= \sum_\text{all x} \text{value of g(x)} \cdot \text{probability of x}\\
&= \sum_\text{all x}g(x)f(x)
\end{align*}$$
```

```ad-note
Expected values are always constant and deterministic. They are non-random, and a 'center' of the distribution
```

```ad-thm
**Linearity of Expected Value:**
For two functions $h(*), g(*)$
$$E[g(X)+h(X)]=E[g(X)]+E[(h(X)]$$
```
