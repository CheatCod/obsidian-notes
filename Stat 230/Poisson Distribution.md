# Poisson Distribution
```ad-def
Suppose that $X$ represents the number of events of some type, occuring at a rate of $\mu > 0$. Then a [[Random Variables|random variable]] $X$ has a Poisson distribution if the probability function of $X$ is:
$$
f(x) = \frac{e^{-\mu}\mu^x}{x!}, \text{for }x =0,1,2...
$$

```
We wrtie $X \sim Poisson(\mu)$

Suppose $X$ has Binomial distribution, $n
