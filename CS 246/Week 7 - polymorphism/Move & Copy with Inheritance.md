# Inheritance and copy/move operations
‚ùå‚úîÔ∏è‚úÖüìó

If no constructor is provided, the default behavior of the constructor would be to call its superclass's constructor, and copy the reset of the fields of the subclass field fields-by-fields.

If we want to mimic this behavior with our own implementation:
```ad-example
~~~c
// Copy ctor:
Text::Text(const Text &other): Book{other}, topic{other.topic} {}

// Copy assignment:
Text &Text::operator=(const Text &other) {
    Book::operator=(other);
    topic = other.topic;
    return *this;
}

// Move ctor:
Text::Text(Text &&other): Book{std::move(other)}, topic{std::move(other.topic)} {}

// Move assignment:
Text &Text::operator=(Text &&other) {
    Book::operator=(std::move(other));
    topic = std::move(other.topic);
    return *this;
}
~~~
```

Note, we called one of `Book`'s constructor/operator first, and then continuing the implementation.
```ad-obs
Even though in the move ctors the `other` "points" at an rvalue, `other` itself is an lvalue, therefore we must use `move()` to force it to be treated as an rvalue. If we don't do so, the copy version of the operations would run.
```

## Partial Assignment

If we were to use pointers to be base class for assignment of an object to another, for ex.

```ad-example
~~~c
Text t1{...}, t2{...}
Book *pb1 = &t1, *pb2 =&t2;

// Copy assign to what pb1 points at to be whatever pb2 points at
*pb1 = *pb2;
~~~
```

Since the assignment op is non-virtual, the base class's implementation is called.
`Book:operator=` is called.

This is called a **partial assignment**, as only the `Book`'s component is copied.

**Potential solution #1**. Make the `operator=` virtual:
```c
class Book {
    . . .
  public:
    virtual Book &operator=(const Book &other);
    virtual Book &operator=(Book &&other);
 };

class Text: public Book {
    . . .
  public:
    Text &operator=(const Book &other) override;
    Text &operator=(Book &&other) override;
 };
```

We can now assign a `Text` object to another one using two pointers of type `Book`.

However, this introduces **mixed assignment**, as now we can assign a `Book` into a `Text`, or a `Comic` into a `Text` and vice-versa. Also, we can't correctly implement the operator since `Book` does not have the fields for `Text`.

**Good solution:** All superclasses should be abstract. To implement this we should restructure the hierarchy.
