# Question 1
```ad-note
- fraction n/d where n and d are int
- d is NON ZERO
- The most simplified form is stored, i.e 4/8 -> 1/2
- Negatives are stored with negative numerator and positive deno, i.e. -1/4
- Divided by  0 is undefined
- Rational numbers that have a denominator of 1 are printed as integers e.g. 17/1 is printed as 17
```
