Why Music?

Music can change the perception of the film

What is a movie?

Movie tells a story, "Suspension of Disbelief".

Music is a risk that threatens the suspension of disbelief.

The focus of most cues will fall on a continuum between Emotion and Action.
Specifically, most cues will have one or more of four basic functions

1. Music can create a more convincing atmosphere of time and place
	- Historical, cultural, geographical, BUT based on western conventions

2. Music can underline or create psychological refinements 
	- The unspoken thoughts of a character or the unseen implications of a situation

3. Music can provide a sense of continuity in a film
	- Structure of music "smoothes over" the discontinuous, chaotic nature of film

4. Music can provide the underpinning for the theatrical buildup of a scene and then round it off with a sense of finality.
	- Music can affect the pacing of a scene
