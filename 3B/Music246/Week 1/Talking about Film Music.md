How do we talk about what we hear?

**Diegesis:** The world of the narrative. All characters, events, etc, depicted, suggested, or described.

**Diegetic Music / Source Music:**
- Music whose source is within the diegesis
- Heard both by the characters within the narrative and the film audience
- Also known as "source music", "direct music", "foreground music"
- Functions include: establishing time and place, creating a sense of "realism and immediacy"

Ex. Whistles, radios, etc

**Nondiegetic Music / Score:**

- Heard by film audience only
- Referred to as the "score", "underscore", or "background music"
- Normally originally composed for the specific film (original score)

Score vs Soundtrack

Score is an original music made specifically for the film

Sound track is music that existed beforehand and the director chose to include

**Adapted Score:** All preexisting music adapted for the film

**Compiled Score:** All preexisting music, used without adaptation.

Ex. 2001, a space odyssey

# Describing the Music

Style:
- What type of music has the composer chosen?
- What type of instruments
- How do these choices relate to the film as a whole


Ex.

## Restoration (1995)

Composer: James Newton Howard

Score is part original part adapted, based on the work of Henry Purcell


## Local Hero (1983)

Composer: Mark Knopfler

Knopfler developed melodies similar to Anglo Celtic folk music.


## The Godfather

Composer: Nino Rota

Style: Starts off with loneliness, single instrument. Continues to a wedding band theme.


# Concept

- Is the music used in a consistent manner throughout the film
- What is accompanied? What is left without accompaniment?
- What "motivates" the music?
	- Action
	- Character
	- Events
	- Objects
	- Flashbacks


# Conceptual Approaches 

Most film music will fall somewhere between two extremes:

A music rarely does only one or the other

1. Playing the drama
Music attempts to reinforce primarily emotional elements within the narrative

2. Hitting the Action
Music accents visual events


## How To Train Your Dragon (2010)

- Dive timed with "friendship" theme
- Beautiful melody drops away when losing cheatsheet and falling
- Friendship theme comes back as hiccup loses cheat sheet, the two becomes one


# Musical Characteristics 

## Melody or Theme

Considered the most "recognizable" music element for western ears

Do characters, objects, or situations have a particular melody associated with them?

## Leitmotif (change of themes)

German Opera composer Richard Wagner came up with the idea of "Leitmotif"

Themes (leitmotif) undergo constant variation in response to narrative development


Ex.

### Star wars ()

Deploys Leitmotif to 

## Tempo or Pulse

- How does the speed of the music influence the "tempo" of the narrative? On-screen action, editing, sound design?
- Music is unexpected for a battle scene
- Also an excellent example of music blurring the line between source music and score

Ex.

### The Return of the King (2004)

Composer: Howard Shore

- Music becomes score from source as the hobbit sings

- Defy expectation of a battle theme

- Uses slow tempo

## Harmony 

- The major scale
	- A set of notes that evolved overtime to be desierable 
	- When music are written in the major scale, people in the western culture finds it familiar
	- Consonant, orderly, tonal
- When moving away from the major scale
	- Harder to predict
	- Dissonant, chaotic, atonal

Ex.

### Cider House Rules (1999)

Composer: Rachael Portman

Major scale

Highly Consonant

### Meet Joe Black

Composer: Thomas Newman

Blend of Consonant and Dissonant

Mysterious, unpredictable 

### Bishop's Countdown from Aliens (1986)

Composer: James Homer

Dissonant

Momentarily changed into major scale
