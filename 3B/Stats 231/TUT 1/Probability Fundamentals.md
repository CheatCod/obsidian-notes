The 3 questions:

1. Before rolling - What is the probability I will roll a 6? (1 in 6)
2. After rolling, after reveal - What is the probability I have rolled a 6 (0 or 1)
3. After rolling, after reveal - What is the probabillity .. (0)

# Random Variables

Framing the previous experience in terms of random variable.

Let $Y$ denote the random variable corresponding to the number we observe when we roll the dice

If we roll the die and it lands on a particular number, then we can say that we have *observed* a particular realization of $Y$. We might write $y$ to denote the result of this die roll.

**Important:** we use upper case letters to denote random variables, and lowercase letter to denote observed values

The dice roll example concerns a discrete random variable. We call it discrete because it can take on a countable number of values, namely $\set{1,2,3,4,5,6}$

A random variable can still be discrete even if it takes on an infinite number of values, as long as it is countably infinite.

# Gaussian Distribution


# P.D.F

The probability density function of a continuous random variable relates ranges of value to probability.

Note that if $Y$ is a continuous random variable than the boundary (less than, leq) does not matter


# Expectation

Just because the expectation of a random variable is a particular value, there is no guarantee that an experiment will result in the expected value.

Instead of thinking of just one experiment, think about it as one of infinite experiment
