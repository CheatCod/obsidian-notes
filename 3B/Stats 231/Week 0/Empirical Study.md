Study of the real world

A key feature of an empirical study is that it involves uncertainty

We'll use probability models to try to model this uncertainty

A **unit** is an individual person, place, or thing about which we can take some measurement(s)

A **population** is a collection of units:
- All current UW undergrad students
- All persons currently aged 90 or over living in Ontario

A **process** is also a collection of units, but those units are "produced" over time.

Both process and population are 

**Variates** are characteristics of the units which are usually represented by letters such as x, y, z

Variates come in many flavours, including:
- Continuous 
- Discrete
- Categorical
- Ordinal
- Complex

**Continuous** variates are those that can be measured - at least in theory - to an infinite degree of accuracy

Ex. height and weight, the lifetime of an electrical component, etc

**Discrete** variates are those that can only take a finite or countably infinite number of values.

Ex. number of car accidents

**Categorical** variates are those where units fall into a non-numeric category

Ex. hair colour, university program

**Ordinal** variates are those where an ordering is implied, but not neccessarily, through a numeric 

**Complex** variates are more unusual, and include open-minded responses to a survey questions. Analyzing complex variates often require conversion to another variates

When making decisions about the type of a variate,

## Types of Empirical studies

### Sample Surveys

Information is obtained about a **finite** population by selecting a 'representative' sample of units from the population and determining the variates of interest for each unit in the sample

Example: Student course perception surveys



### Observational studies

Information about a population or process is collected *without any attempt to change one or more variates* for the sample units.

### Experimental studies

In contrast to observational studies, an experimental study is one in which the experimenter intervenes and changes or sets the value of one or more variates for the units of the study
