Study of the real world

A key feature of an empirical study is that it involves uncertainty

We'll use probability models to try to model this uncertainty

A **unit** is an individual person, place, or thing about which we can take some measurement(s)

A **population** is a collection of units:
- All current UW undergrad students
- All persons currently aged 90 or over living in Ontario

A **process** is also a collection of units, but those units are "produced" over time.

Both process and population are 

**Variates** are characteristics of the units which are usually represented by letters such as x, y, z

Variates come in many flavours, including:
- Continuous 
- Discrete
- Categorical
- Ordinal
- Complex

**Continuous** variates are those that can be measured - at least in theory - to an infinite degree of accuracy

Ex. height and weight, the lifetime of an electrical component, etc

**Discrete** variates are those that can only take a finite or countably infinite number of values.

Ex. number of car accidents

**Categorical** variates are those where units fall into a non-numeric category

Ex. hair colour, university program

**Ordinal** variates are those where an ordering is implied, but not neccessarily, through a numeric 

**Complex** variates are more unusual, and include open-minded responses to a survey questions. Analyzing complex variates often require conversion to another variates

When making decisions about the type of a variate,
